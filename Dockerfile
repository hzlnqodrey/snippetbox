# CGO_ENABLED [This environment variable disables the use of the cgo (C compiler) during the build process. It's often used in statically compiled Go binaries to ensure that the binary is fully self-contained and doesn't rely on external C libraries.]
# GOOS=linux [This environment variable specifies the target operating system for the build. In this case, it's set to linux to build a Linux executable.]
# -a [This flag tells the Go build tool to rebuild all the packages, even if they are already up to date. It ensures that all dependencies are included and up to date.]
# -installsuffix cgo [This flag specifies an install suffix for the package directory. In this case, it's set to cgo, which means that the build process should avoid using cgo, as mentioned earlier.]
# -o snippetboxapp [This flag specifies the output binary name (snippetboxapp in this case).]
